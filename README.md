This is a simple automator to download multiple TableBuilder crosstab tables at once.

It makes life easier during peak load hours on the ABS servers. 

Best played with manually, in my opinion. This is not a rerunnable script and should be used with deference. The ABS servers are awfully laggy most hours of the day (the best time to download, in my most humble and honest opinion, is 3 AM) and one would hope not to be a causal node in the tragedy of the commons.
